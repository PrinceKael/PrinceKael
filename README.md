- 👋 Hi, I’m @PrinceKael
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, philosophy, politics, psychology and learning from people, partying and anything you can interest me in
- 🌱 I’m currently learning depending on what I'm working on a little bit of C, C++, Python, Ruby, Ocaml, PHP, Javascript, Rust, R, Scala, Lua etc. (Just basic syntax, I'm total noob.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source software, free (as in beer) software especially in privacy-related areas and Linux, video game employment and maybe employment or experience. Even just for a good time. Also a streamer, shitposter, INTEL guru, student and gamer.
- 📫 How to reach me reddit on u/mana-addict4652, twitch.tv/manavein or twitter @Stratosbrah
